# School Donation Analysis

**Author:** Manichandrika

## Project Overview

The School Donation Analysis project aims to explore and analyze donation data to gain insights into patterns and trends in school donations. By leveraging data analysis techniques, this project seeks to provide valuable information that can inform decision-making and strategies for improving donation efforts in educational institutions.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following key components:

* **`School Donation Analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the primary data analysis and visualizations.

* **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and documentation for the project.

* **`.gitignore`**: A file specifying which files and directories to ignore in version control.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manichandrika1380/School-Donation-Analysis.git
   cd School-Donation-Analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment**:

   * It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using:

     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you may need to manually install necessary libraries such as:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. **Run the analysis**:

   Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then, open `School Donation Analysis.ipynb` to begin your analysis.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook contains a series of steps for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. By executing each cell, you can follow the analysis process and modify it as needed to suit your specific dataset or objectives.
